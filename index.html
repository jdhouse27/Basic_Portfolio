    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>Where do I begin?  I suppose I should start at the beginning.  I started off as most do with computers in that I was terrified if I got into an area of the unknown
        I would surely break something beyond possible fixing.  This series of unfortunate events would not only distroy my pride, but also would end up costing me more then 
        I could ever dream of.  I will admit there are still many areas that scare the living daylights out of me.  However, by the time I finish the KU Bootcamp I will have 
        gained many skills which have not only allowed me to face my fears head on, but also given me the confidence to not only be a good web developer but rather a top notch
        web developer.  I will have become the developer many want to employ.   
    </p>  

    <p>I have always been good at things I put my mind to and I look forward to the next chapters in my life.  I have experience in health care, food and beverage, management,
        owner of a business, and now web development.  My experience in health care consists of 9 years as a Registered Respiratory Therapist, as well as 3 years of EMR application 
        support.  In the Food and Beverage industry I have experience in all aspects, server, bartender, expoditor, cook, manager, general manager. My experience with 
        web development has just begun, however throughout this website you will notice the many skills I currently have. Though my expertise may not be extremely advanced yet 
        I live by a motto my grandfather taught me: "Lack of progression leads to regression".  I am always looking for new growth and advancement.
